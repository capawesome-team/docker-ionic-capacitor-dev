## Security

This container is shipped with an RSA key that allows debugging through the container.
This means you won't have to accept a new RSA key on your device every time you run the container.
While convenient, it means that your device will be accessible over ADB to others who possess the key.
You can use `docker run` with `-v /your/adbkey_folder:/root/.android` to supply your own key.
